### Hi, I'm Yuxun He 👋

I’m a master student in the Department of Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins University.

I was born and grew up in Shanghai - one of the biggest cities in the world, where diverse culture blends seamlessly with rapid modernization, offering endless opportunities for exploration and inspiration.

In my free time, I enjoy hiking, playing snooker and badminton, and exploring computer games—they help me stay balanced and creative beyond studying.
